<!-- TITLE: Delete lines from file -->
# With sed

To delete lines 2, 12-17 and line 57 from file data.txt using sed you could do something like this:


```sh
sed -e '2d;12,17d;57d' data.txt
```

To create a backup of the original file (with a .bak extension) use -i.bak with the command.

```sh
sed -i.bak -e '2d;12,17d;57d' data.txt
```
