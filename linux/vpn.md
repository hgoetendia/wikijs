## Solution

i finally got this working!!! one the other side, the third party had enabled pfs at their side, yet at my side i had disabled pfs, (pfs=no).. the third party have a cisco asa fw!, after disabling pfs, everything worked like charm, SA were established.. and would ping their LAN nodes behind the ASA fw!!
